Ambience is too good for a pleasant evening. Service is very prompt. Food is good. Over all a good experience. Soumen Das - kudos to the service

"Its a very nice place, ambience is different, all the food we ordered was very tasty, service is also gud, worth visit. Its reasonable as well. Really a must visit place."
Well after reading so many reviews finally visited this place...ambience was so good and coming to food crispy corn is nice. Tawa fish was ok... Basket Biryani disappointed us... biryani was ok but not flattering as they claimed.. Staff was polite and prompt especially pradeep and Suman.
"Excellent food , specially if you like spicy food . Courteous staff . Shubro and pradeep and papiya gave excellent service to our corporate team dinner . Overall great for team dinners and party"
"Came for the birthday treat of a close friend. Perfect place for a treat like this. Very hospitable and cooperative staff. Food was delicious, ambience was really good with the music and the lighting. Chili honey lotus stem is a must try here. Special mention to Papiya who took good care of us."
The service was great and the food was awesome. The service staff Manab and Papiya were very courteous and attentive. I would like to come frequently to this place
"Very good ambience, amazing food ,good service and friendly staff - Pradeep, Papiya and Shuvro :) will definitely visit again! And loved the design of their menu card."
Food was very good. Soup was as expected. In starters we ordered honey chilli lotus stem and that is a must try for vegan ppl. Service was great. Frequent visits from Papiya to know our experience and also about the food was really impressive.
Food is too good. Telangana kodiak fry is must try.Mutton biriyani is too good.Papiya helped to choose best dishes and attended very well.Must visit.
"We ordered corn cheese balls, manchow soup and paneer shashlik sizzler. The sizzler was stale. Paneer was smelling and the waiter was so impolite to even accept the mistake. Never going again"
Food and ambience is fantastic.. Waiter Manav Maji was really quick in his service.. Cheese Balls is a must try starter as it was very scrumptious
"Came here for lunch and the food was good and tasty. We tried buffet and all the items in veg and non-veg were tasty.

The ambience and service were also good, and the staff were courteous.

The best thing about this place is the food. My favorite go to dish here is definitely Alfredo Pasta although other items are good as well. And the service and behavior of the staff is top-notch. We we're attended by Mr. Soumen Das and he was extremely polite. Will definitely visit soon.
Polite and friendly staff. Nice ambience and good spread of menu. Drinks are awesome. Service is very good by manav... looking forward to seeing it again...
"Food is really good. We had vegetarian items including paneer, mushroom and kofta. Additionally service from Papiya , Shuvro was really good."
"Beautiful, cozy and classy at the same time, this place is truly recommended for your special days. With 15 percent corporate discounts, you can treat your cotorie well without burning a hole ur pocket. Also, the interior is done so well, you ll love the vibe. On the menu, honey chilli lotus stems, basket biryanis, sizzling brownies were my favourite. Also loved the tomato basil shorba, different from the creamy standards in other restaurants. I'm definitely making more visits to Beyond Flavours. Special mention to Papiya, our hostess for the evening, excellent service :)"
"please was good but it was quite expensive and coming to taste we can rate 3 out of 5, we cant click better pictures wen we visit in nightü§£ü§≠best in day time for pics"
Service was too good and fast. Even these people were so polite and well behaving. Manav and pradeep you were good. Hope everyone behaves the same way
"We had our farewell feast here recently enjoyed very well very good management so does the boys who gave complimentary food and made us more happy
Food was perfect desserts, starters was wonderful"
"Excellent experience, mouthwatering food, good ambience, a must go place in hyderabad. We were served by Shubhro and Papiya. They were awesome in their behaviour. Had an enjoyable evening with friends."
The place is very good.. 5* to the live music.. She is just superb with beautiful voice.. Food is nice n loved the lightning..üòçentrance is also very nice..
"Sonalin has a great voice.. üòç must visit the place once.. became fan of her. The food is good.. 5 star from my side. Live music, lightening everything is just awesome üòç"
I heard her voice..she is too beautiful with amazing voice ..just love her voice the way she sings üòç became fan of Sonalin Priyadarshini. Good place must visit. The food is also nice..
Sonalin is a very good singer in the city.. beautiful face with beautiful face must visit this place .. Beautiful live music.. loved it.. üòç loved the food as well. Very good lightning.
"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time."
"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!"
"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..
Ambience was good too with live music. Food was served timely. Decor of the restaurant was amazing as well."
My review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot's of place even though the food is good in places like these. Special hey to papiya shuvro!
"It was a very nice experience. Food was amazing. Friendly staff, with welcoming attitude. Papia was very friendly and accommodating. Good ambiance. I will definitely recommend this place."
"Had dinner with my friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Papia was very accommodating. Good ambience with amazing live music. Will be back definitely!"
Service experience was very good especially by Papiya. Food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well. I would like to visit Beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price.
"Service , Food and Ambiance was very nice. Staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food. Live music was like cherry on the cake"
The food was ‚ù§Ô∏è.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.
Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.
"I came here with my parents. We ordered for Thai peneer tikka, kaju pulao and veg biryani. The kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good. This is a decent place to go with family. Shubro and papiya served well."
Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience
"Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service."
"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
Shoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon."
"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"
Had lunch today at beyond flavors .The food was very Good and delicious and awesome service was provided by Soumen Das & Shuvro. Would highly recommend the restaurant .
The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.
"Service is really exceptional. Cheers to Manav, who served us really well. Food was nice too. Loved the ambience too, with nice music playing in the background."
"Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!"
Papiya Shuvro was great. She helped us get the tables quickly and suggested us the best sizzlers in the menu. Ambience was awesome. She suggested the best table and was very helpful till we were there. Will visit again for the awesome service. You guys should try as well if u plan to take your loved one n give an osm experience then this is the place.
"Quite good ambience,liked special restro biryani,must try,like the service Papiya and shuvro,they were really good at der service.will like to visit again.Its nice place to visit specially at nyt tym.food was yum.Should try biryani."
Pradeep and shubroto were amazing and friendly. Service was awesome n food out of the world.must visit for all people out there. Will visit again
We visited this place for a colleagues farewell. We had a really great time.Good food and service by Pradeep and Shobro. Will come again later
"The restaurant has an amazing ambience. Staff is polite and suggest good recommendations on food. If you visit Beyond Flavours sometime, do reach out to Papiya and Shuvro as she can suggest some really good dishes."
Excellent food and service. Special mention for Papiya Shuvro. Surprised to see such good quality food being served at such low prices. Ambience is quite good too. Highly recommended.
Papiya and Shuvro as the f&b executives were really courteous and friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. Good place for a cute Lil date hehe and for a nice family dinner.
"This was the first time we visited this restaurant and the experience was good in terms of food, hospitality, service and ambience. Thanks to shubro and papiya for their hospitality"
"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."
The place is just beyond beautiful. Ambience is excellent and food is good. The service by Soumen Das is extremely good. Highly recommended place.
"I have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.
I would specially recommend their soups, the healthy broth soup and the roasted chicken soup are amazing.
In addition the service is great and our server Papiya was very courteous and prompt. This place has become my go to place for a good dining experience."
If you have time to waste for taste u r most welcome ... the taste was really superb but the service was very very slow..! Dishes were impressively having different flavours which i liked..!
The food here is good and would add on if you could increase your spread.Ananya was courteous and good at serving..!!Ambience was also good and was peaceful...........................!!!!!!!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
"Pardeep and shubrat has served great food and great ambience. Must try !!!

The food is awesome and ambience is too good. A great place to go with a team"
"One of the best restaurants in Hyderabad near Gachibowli.. ambiance was good.. Lunch spread was good and was very tasty.
Thank Papiya for her guidance."
I really liked the food here it was different from what we get in every other restaurant ..really appreciate the service by Papiya..loved the presentation of the food..
Had a good food and good time at this place.. Ambience was really good and had a nice time... Thanks @shubro for assistance and guidance for having food..
"Best place to hangout...üòä
Food is really great...
Thanks Papiya for the service...üòä
Staff was reallly co-operative...
Ambience is really great, especially PDR(Private Dining Room) is awesome...üòçüëåüèª"
"we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,"
"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."
"Second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. Very courteous staff and very hospitile.
Taste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .
Very impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up."
"We ordered Vegetable Lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka, both of which were absolutely delicious. The ambience is amazing and the service is good."
One of the best food experiences I had in hyderabad. The desserts was yum. Appricot pudding is must have. @Ahmed Khan your service was unparalled. Keep up the good work.
"Ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... He may suggest great food as he has good experience. The staters and sizzler was too good. The sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. Nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
Great experience in beyond flavors."
Had dinner at this place and the attendant was Papiya. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome. Good variety of food and beverages.
"We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good .We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.The buffet spread was one of a kind:
Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!
Overall :3.2"
"Good Ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
I‚Äôve got best company here by ANANYA (Beyond Flavours)
The place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
Great place for friends."
"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"
"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."
"It's one of the best places to hangout with friends. Seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc.
Food was very good and the ambience was also very nice.
Loved everything.‚ù§"
Ambience is good and staff are polite and friendly. Food is super good and had nice time having lunch .... keep up the good work. Thank you for your nice hospitality. Loved it üíï üíï üíï
"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."
"Hostile staff, okeish food, not so great ambiance. Not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 4.1
Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place."
"Thanks Ahmed Food is great will recommend to visit again and again. Service is excellent and ambience is good , we had a great time with my family"
"This is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good ,beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of money.i am personally highly recommend this place.great flavour of food and very much prompt service.ambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant."
Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.
"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service."
This is the place I really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food lover.pasta and sizzlers are so yummy that I cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than other.service is the part were you really satisfied.
"I'm very much impressed by the quality of food and service. Specially Mr Ahmed, thank you for your politeness and readiness. About food i can only say that it is beyond flavours. Loved this place. Must visit, great ambience."
The food was indeed beyond falvours. Ahmed served us well. Hoping to meet next time soon. A great ambience and amazing songs on the background added innumerous flavours to the delicious food.
Starters are very good and service is also good. Ahmed is very polite and helped us selecting menu.l which tuned out be great. Would like to come back again.
"Had a very bad experience here
beyond flavours really puts you beyond all the flavours
had gone here for dinner and the next day had to get hospitalised because of food infection
I guess the food was not served fresh"
Lovely ambience..Roasted chicken soup was the Highlight of our dinner..Basket biryani was full of flavours and yumm.lasagne was great.Nice to go with whole family.Appetisers quantity is less though.
I liked the food and ambience but the problem is with the staff.. they are not so responsive.. we‚Äôve ordered one item but we got something else.. otherwise place and the food are good..
It‚Äôs a worst service experience. Food was OK. They took 45mins to get veg pulav. Never seen a restaurant to take such time. Won‚Äôt visit again.
Waiters are not good enough and you will get items which you have not ordered. Overall a bad experience. Waiting time is more than expected...
"Awesome food, very good ambience, centrally located, ample parking....coordination between serving boys / service has scope for improvement, boys very courteous though. Not sure why the bar was closed on a Saturday evening....Overall good experience & extremely value for money....will visit again!"
Was there for office lunch outing. Rating would be mixed because food was fine but service was very bad. Booked table a day before but still had to wait for 30-40 mins to get one. Manager was polite but gave some rubbish reasons for bad service. Ambiance is fine.
"I really enjoyed the follows....
The entrance, the music, lighting, seating arrangement, decorations everything is just awsome. The food and the best service enhance the flavour of the restaurant. I realy recommend this restaurant..."
"I came first time in this restaurant.
The entrance, the music, lighting, seating arrangement, decorations everything is just awsome. The food and the best service enhance the flavour of the restaurant."
"Pathetic and horrible experience
Ambience and hospitality 1
Food 1
chairs and tables were broken food is cold and tasteless
Buffet arrangement is not good could be a bit more spacious"
Ahmed was serving us. Polite and very cooperative staff..Amazing food and Ambience..Veg gilaffi Kabab and Lasgna was a must try..Loved overall experience....
